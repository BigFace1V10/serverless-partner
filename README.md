## Intro To Serverless HACKATHON
*Throughout the bootcamp, you will be presented with a problem each week that aims to reinforce the skills you learned that week.*
### ✏️ Guidelines
* You can work individually or with a partner
* You will submit your code by committing to your own repository
* Fork this repo to get started!

### 🚀 How does it work?
**Each week's assignment will be on a different branch of this repository (Example: For Week 1, select the `week-1` branch). Each branch will have a README.md that contains the assignment.**

> **Where do I commit?** Commit to the folder provided on each branch.

> :bulb: **Tip**: You should merge each branch into main after you complete each assignment!
